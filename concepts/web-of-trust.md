# Web Of Trust

This document aims to give a general understanding of what is Web Of Trust. How it's built and how we utilise the Universal Dividend as a fair measurement of an individuals net value in society into the Web of Trust. These data points now become verified "sources of truth" about an individual in society and can be used to build contracts/agreements amongst each other.

Web of Trust are trust/knowledge graphs built by its participants voluntarily. A web of trust is essentially a "graph" with "nodes" in this graph as users and "links" between them are "connections" or in more subtle terms, used to define relationships between them.
