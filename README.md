## <span id="introduction">Introduction</span>
The Transfer Of Value(TOV) Protocol aims to be a protocol standard for blockchains to interop with each others economic goods/services.

Here is a short clip of a longer video by Andreas on "what is money"

[![Money is the killer app](https://github.com/AireshBhat/TOVProtocol/assets/23222537/96727c33-28b8-48cb-93ec-27a221d0972b)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxIrc1rxhyI?si=nMVEtFct5IjMbUva&amp;clip=Ugkxpo3Qw-kWtUMIJoW7v2K51I3AA9iKGgKi&amp;clipt=ELDqARjwpQM)

Understanding money and its psychological effects it has on us is something that hasn't been touched upon as an educational topic. We aren't taught what money is? Why is money created? How is it created? The answers to all these questions define how society is built around us. Money functions as the oil that runs the economy. How money functions also define how we create relationships between individuals we deal with.

## <span id="theory">Theory</span>

The basic idea here is to formalise a metric to measure the "value" of a service/good. This allows us to compare the same good across "economics zones", easing exchange of materials between individuals who use different currencies.

### <span id="the-relative-theory-of-money">[The Relative Theory of Money](http://en.trm.creationmonetaire.info/index.html)</span>

>"Physical laws are expressed in the same way (have the same form) in all repositories" (inertial or non-inertial repositories) - Theory of Relativity

The Relative Theory of money suggests that money be created in the form of a universal dividend, the value which is a percentage of money supply, that itself has a lifetime matching the lifetime of the participants taking part in the economy.

> c: **Relative** amount of new money created (please pay attention to "relative") during a given "**small**" time period (please pay attention to "small")
> ev: Average life expectancy (Inside the economic zone)

In today's financial system, the money we use "never" dies. Here the value c has "bounds", it can take on a Relative value between these bounds and is recalculated when it exceeds them(cure to issuance of new currency)

>In ecology, no species creates waste that other species cannot use. - Ch 10. The Law of Return, [Sacred Economics](http://sacred-economics.com/sacred-economics-chapter-10-the-law-of-return/)

We are introduced here to a currency whose value decays as time progresses, similar to how inflation reduces the value of money in todays economy, however not the same. Money is created by centralised entities in the forms of loans, thus increasing the money supply. Relative Theory of money suggests a new way to create this "free currency" that imbibes properties beneficial to the sustainance of an economy rather than debt, the property currency imbibes today. What "properties" are this?

The currency of a "free economy/currency" must allow a user to:
* Use resources; e.g. Public goods such as public transport, parks, technological innovations such as radio, TCP/IP(internet)
* Create and assign value; e.g. Price your good or commodity as per your judgement,
* Chose any monetary system of their liking
* And trade with its currency

What is a "free currency"?
A free currency is one that possesses the attributes of freedom of an individual. Here freedom, according to the RTM book, talks about "non nuisance" to oneself and others. This means that the percentage of a resource I'm consuming shouldn't block others who are in need of the same free resource.

**Ownership**

A free currency is one that is created "freely" by all the members of that community. The currency created is written in code and follows an algorithm for equal distribution amongst its members. 

A debt currency is one that is created by an entity with the expectation that it be returned, **even more** than was lent. This ties the individual to the issuer of the loan. More has been explained here as "[enslavement by the missing interest"](http://en.trm.creationmonetaire.info/probleme-de-la-monnaie-dette.html#c-l-asservissement-par-l-interet-manquant)


#### <span id="ud-as-a-universal-measurement-of-value">UD as a universal measurement of value</span>
In the RTM it states that, when economic goods/services are measured in terms of Universal Dividend, the rise and fall of the price accordingly denotes the rise and fall of the good/service. For eg. let's assume the US dollar was a free currency and 1 UD<sub>\$</sub> is worth 470\$. If a car priced at 100 UD<sub>\$</sub> after one year started selling at 120 UD<sub>\$</sub>, one can safely assume that the value of the car has increased. Normally, we tend to think the opposite, that the value of dollar has decreased, hence the increase in the price of the goods. 

Measuring in UD allows us to compare goods across economic zones, i.e. economies that deal with different currencies. The value an artist provides measured in UD<sub>`MUSIC`</sub> can be compared to the value a software developer provides in UD<sub>`GITHUB`</sub>

The number of UDs flowing through an identity/entity can now be a fair measure of the value that identity is contributing to the economy.


## <span id="framework">Framework</span>
Each blockchain community is its own economic zone if they implement their own currency generation. A blockchain community uses the UD as a tool to fairly measure the value of the goods and services its peers provide.

### <span id="usecase">Usecase</span>
>Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to store humanity's most important information.
Let us apply the concept of a UD to one of the most advanced blockchains out there, Filecoin.

#### <span id="tokenomics">Tokenomics</span>
New tokens are distributed equally amongst all members of the community. The amount of tokens provided to each peer in the community is decided by the formula:
